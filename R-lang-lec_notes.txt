************ 11 - Assigning vecs

--- Declare vec

vec = c(#,#,#) etc.  -- c stands for combine

vec = 1:5 or 4:8  etc.

or 1.5:5.5, iterates by 1

--- Objs in vec

vec[1] is obj #1

vec[1:4] is obj 1 through 4

vec[-1]  all but obj 1
vec[-3]  all but obj 3
vec[-(1:3)] all but objs 1 to 3

--- Combining vecs together

vec = c(vec1,vec2, scalar, 1:5, -4:-3) --> all work

length(vec) returns the size

--- String vec, boolean vec

char_vec = c(string1, string2...)

boovec = c(T,T,F...)

--- Combining vecs of dif types

They combine into a vec of strings

--- Ops on vecs

vec*2 works

vec+10 adds 10 to each elt

vec^2 squares each obj

can do ops on vecs, *if* they are the same size


************ 12 - Sequences

seq(from = #, to = #, by = #), and the nums can be decimals and negative

can do boolean comparisons too, e.g. seq(5) == 1:5, and same with vectors

all( seq(5) == 1:5 ) --> rets true if all are true, only

rep(1,5) --> repeats 1 exactly 5 times

rep (c(1:3) , 5 ) --> will repeat the vec 1,2,3 now 5 times


************** 13 - Basic stat'l functs

sum(vec) --> sums it up

min,max,range  --> as expected, and can combine vecs in the args, too

range also has elts 1 and 2, give the min and max themselves

mean, median -> the avg

mad ---> mean something..

var = variance

sd = standev

Ok, now to e.g. test if 68% of a vec falls within one standev, you can do this:

lowerbound = mean(vec) - sd(vec)
upperbound = mean(vec) + sd(vec)

boolvec that says if an elt is within one standev:

boolvec = (vec > lowerbound)  & (vec < upperbound)

sum(boolvec) --> only sums the true vals of the boolvec, and should give ~68% for any dist

cor(vec1, vec2) --> corrln

cov --> covariance

table --> shows freq of vals inside of a vec



************** 14 - Matrices

assign as so: matrix(c(3,5,234,1),nrow=2,ncol=4)

t(mat) = transpose

dim(mat) = dimns

t(vec) = transpose of a vec

amat[r,c] is the r'th element of the row, c'th elt of the column

amat[1,] is all stuff in row 1
amat[,1] is all stuff in col 1

You can assign just nrows or ncols and it will divide # of elts by the
one you give, and then assign the other the result of this division.  Interesting.

newmat = amat(c(2,4),] --> this will take the 2nd and 4th rows of amat, and put them into newmat

diag(4) = diagonal mat of 1's along main diag

You can do the normal mult, divide, sqrt etc. functs as normal

Can do ops on 2 mats if they have same dimns

dim(amat)[1] --> is num rows, same as nrow funct
dim(amat)[2] --> is num cols, same as ncol funct

Doing amat == bmat will return a boolean in each location, doing
all(amat==bmat) will return a single bool of true for if each elt
matches.


************** 15 - Matrix Ops

---> My first cxample script: see mat_ops_Exx_CityTemps.R

paste funct concats strings together

cbind, rbind -- adding cols or rows to a mat


c(matrix) will uncurl the mat into a linear array of just the elts,
then you can do length on it and check vs. dimns etc.



************** 16 - Basic Matrix Stats

min,max,range,sd
rowMeans
colMeans
apply(mat, 1 or 2, FUN = sd)
cor(mat) 
summary
summary(t(mat))

************** 17 - Random nums

random uniform: runif(numRandoms, startval, endval) 
set.seed(int) -- to replicate same sequence

sample( set, numvals, replace=T or F) # set can be e.g. 1:10 or a mat
or a vec you've created, and numvals is how many vals to pick from
that set, replace says if i can draw the same value again

sum(sample ...) will sum it up

state.name # All the US states

s = sample(1:5,1000,replace = T,prob = c(0.1,0.2,0.3,0.1,0.0001)) ; table(s) # The prob is how often to draw that val, and the sum does *not* have to be 1, it renorms all probs to get the right vals

rnorm(numvals, mean, sd)  # Default: mean = 0, sd of 1 -- Gaussian dist

************** 18 - String functs

substr(str, start, end) # str can be a vec of strings too

paste(str1, str2,...,strN, sep = '') # pastes together -- sep defaults
to one blank space

# Can do paste to vec of strings too

grep(searchstr, strvec, value = T or F) # Will return which locations
of the strvec the searchstr occurs in; value is by default F, but if T
it will return the strings at those locations

strsplit(str, substr to split on)

sub( substr to search and replace for, substr to sub in, the orig str)  # First occurrence subst

gsub( substr to search and replace for, substr to sub in, the orig str) # Global subst

************** 19 - Times and dates

Sys.Date()
Sys.time()

seq(as.POSIXct("2015-08-15"), as.POSIXct("2015-08-20"), by = 'hour')

difftime


************** 20 - line plots

xg = rnorm(1000)
xu = runif(1000)
csum = cumsum(xg)

plot(xg)

plot(xu,type='CHAR', col = 'COLORNAME', ylim = c(MINVAL, MAXVAL)) # We
have l=line, p = point (default), h = histo, o = lines and points, s =
steps, COLORNAME = blue, red, green, cyan,

lines( newplotinfo ) will just add to the plot already made

# Can use cbind on vecs too, useful to get the limits, and rowMeans
  will work on this obj too

points( otherinfo ) 



************** 21 - Plotting args

lines( newplotinfo , ylim = range(data), lty = NUM, lwd = LINEWIDTH,
main = TITLE, xlab = X-AXIS LABEL, ylab = Y-AXIS LABEL ) # NUM can be
1, solid, 2, 3 etc. ; LINEWIDTH = 1 by default, can make smaller or
larger



************** 22 - Bar graphs and histos

barplot
hist
rchi
as.matrix


************** 23 - Scatterplots

head(DATASET) - gives the info in the header lines
attach(DATASET) - tells R that this is the dataset we're about to use
plot(x=DATA1, y=DATA2)
abline(lm(DATA1~DATA2) ) # Does the regression fit, and plots it
abline(h = horiz maxline, v = vert maxline)
pairs(~Weight+Price+~MPG.city) # Will do scatter plots of all 3 of these vs. each other



dotchart # Can put labels on etc. -- this one is a bit unclear

orderCars = Cars93[order(MPG.city), ] # Ordergs by MPG, but by nothing elxe

cex = how large to make the labels


************** 24 - Prob plots

# These are not well-explained, but one gets the rough idea of how well 2 dists match
qqnorm
qqline 
qqplot
scaled
rchisq

************** 25 - Combining and saving plots

par(mfrow=c(2,2)) # Makes plots in 2x2 format

plot(x=DATA1 , y = DATA2)


R-ploggers website talks about par and margin function

save plots as pdf, or png etc.

layout(matrix(c(1,2,1,3), ncol = 2, nrow = 2, byrow=T))


************** 26 - Arrays

x = 1:9
 ax=array(x)
 attributes(ax)
$dim

 attributes(ax)$dim
 ax=array(x,dim=c(3,3))
 attributes(ax)$dim

ax=array(x,dim=c(3,2,2)) # This is 2 3x2 arrays

ax[1:2, 2, ] = 42 # Assign 42 into both rows 1 and 2, second col, both arrays

# Arrays can of course be any number of dimns


************** 27 - Lists

# Declare three vecs of dif types, lengths etc.
x = list(nums,strs, bools)

x[[2]][1] gives the first elt of vec 2 in the list etc.

x = list("numname"=nums,"strname"=strs, "bool-list"=bools)

Can get the vec by:

x$numname

attach(x)

numname will give that

detach(x) # Opposite of attach

unlist(x) # Creates vec of strings of each obj -- collapses it


newx = c(x, "sysdate" = as.character(Sys.Date() ) ) # Add another vec to the list
